# Design Improvement TODOs

Future UI/UX improvements to consider for the macOS RSS reader app.

## Reading Experience

### Reading Progress Indicator
For long articles, show:
- A thin progress bar at the top of the article view
- "X min read" estimate based on word count
- Resume position when returning to partially-read articles

### Reader Mode Toggle
Add a distraction-free reading mode that:
- Hides the sidebar and article list
- Centers content with optimal reading width
- Uses clean, book-like typography

## Interaction Improvements

### Quick Preview on Hover
Add a popover preview when hovering over articles in the list (like Mail.app's quick look), showing more of the summary without full selection.

### Drag & Drop
- Drag feeds between categories
- Drag articles to save or mark read

## Visual Polish

### Empty State Illustrations
Add friendly illustrations to empty states (no articles, no feeds) rather than just text and icons.

### Transition Animations
- Animate article selection transitions
- Add subtle fade when switching between grouping modes
- Smooth scroll-to-selection

### Status Bar Enhancements
Expand the server status indicator to show:
- Last refresh time
- Number of new articles since last check
- Sync status with subtle animation

## Sharing & Integration

### Improved Share Sheet
- Add "Copy Summary" option
- Share with AI-generated summary included

### Touch Bar Support
- Quick actions: next/previous, bookmark, mark read
- Feed switching

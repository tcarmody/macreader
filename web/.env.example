# DataPoints Web PWA Configuration
#
# This file contains example environment variables for the web frontend.
# Copy this to .env.local and fill in your values.

# Backend API URL (required for production)
# This should point to your deployed backend server (e.g., on Railway)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app

# For local development, the Vite dev server proxies /api to localhost:5005
# so you don't need to set VITE_API_URL locally
